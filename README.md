# E-commerce Checkout CI Tests

This project demonstrates how CI pipelines can be used to protect the stability of e-commerce checkout logic.

The repository contains:
- A `Checkout` class that simulates common e-commerce scenarios such as bundle discounts, subscription discounts and taxes.
- A set of automated tests using `pytest` that validate different flows and edge cases.
- A GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests on every push and pull request to prevent faulty code from being merged into `main`.

This project is part of a QA and test automation portfolio, focused on reliability, data consistency, and CI/CD practices.
